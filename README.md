Hello enthus! Welcome to my simple machinelearning task, where numerous classification methods are applied to find whether a passenger survived or not!

Here I have accomplished:
1.Basic data preprocessing
2.Data visualization
3.Data splitting
4.Model creation and data deployment
5.Generated the epic metrics classification report to find precision, recall, accuracy, weighted accuracy etc
